**Interesting Problems:** As a recreational caver, I would find it very interesting to look at cave survey data (although such data usually gaurded and difficult to access) and compare it against USGS elevation/hydrography studies. The goal would be to try to find which ridges are most likely to have undiscovered caves, especially caves with lots of passage or deep pits.  
**Image:** This is a color coded map of Alabama. The northeast corner is part of a region abbreviated TAG (Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia), an area that already has over 14,000 known caves and probably many more unknown.
